    complex function graphic

1.daily:
    10/4:
    1. learning how to set new windows screen
    2. typing the rotational cube from the website
    
    10/12:
    1. learning how to use easy way to solve matrix dot
    2. notes about pygame notes(drawing circle)
    
    10/31:
    1. started to do some easy job(seperate imagine question to real number)
    2. design a circle with gpt(mine can't do that)
    
    11/7:
    1. started to type the main code of figure 1(real x with imagine y)
    2. using gpt to tidy my code
    
    11/9:
    1. learing how to type words and color on pygame
    
    11/10:
    1. tidy the code again
    2. type another code with the same method figure 2(x with imagine y)
    3. try to learn how to design 3d model, but failed
    
    11/11:
    1. trying 3d with easy way, but failed

    1. above these line is just I do it for reference. In fact, I made the projection matrix in my own way. 
    2. finishing the 3d matrix graph in a very ugly graph. However the approxiamtely trend of the graph is correct.
    3. fisnishing the graph of x ** x, also done the button problem
    4. design a new way of the projection matrix

2. the function of the code

   Making 4 kinds of graph with code. These 4 graphic are two on the 2d plane and two on the 3d plane. Using projection matrix to make it show on the graph

3. The way to use to code
   
    Install pygame at powershell in vs code(Terminal --> new terminal). Press start then the code started. When you want to change it to the next graph, press the bottom with typing words. Then you can change it to the next graph. If you want to stop the code, wait for a few seconds then it will close or you can just press cross on the new screen. If you want to make the code to maintain at a specific time, use your mouse to hold the new screen's upside, it will stop until your mouse is not holding at it.

5. Architecture of the code
   
    divert it into 4 parts. Each part using independent parameter to make it work well without interference other code working. Using a bottom to change these graph enviroment.
